What's this?" <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> clicked on the picture of the book, and a prompt appeared: "Use 'Programming Language Skill Book' now?"</p><p data-line="5" class="pr-line-array">“Yes!” <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> agreed, and immediately a surge of information flooded into his brain, leaving behind some memory information that he did not originally have.</p><p data-line="6" class="pr-line-array">That was some information about computer programs and programming. This was part of <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span>'s original major, but it mostly covered basic knowledge.</p><p data-line="7" class="pr-line-array">The information in the red envelopes sent by <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="红后">Red Queen</span> is not only comprehensive, but also completely high-end! It's safe to say that mastering this knowledge makes <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> a top-tier software engineer!</p><p data-line="8" class="pr-line-array">With his knowledge, he could easily work at companies like Tencent, Alibaba, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="千度">Thousand Degrees</span>, or even international giants like <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="苹果">Apple</span> and <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="微软">Microsoft</span>, let alone this small <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="死神游戏公司">Death God Game Company</span>!</p><p data-line="9" class="pr-line-array"><span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> was overjoyed. He was like the hungry traveler on the riverbank in the story, who was given a fishing rod and a fish by God, who did not let him choose one, but gave him both!</p><p data-line="10" class="pr-line-text">These game software programs alone could be resold for millions of dollars. And the knowledge he possessed transformed him completely.</p><p data-line="11" class="pr-line-array"><span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> was overjoyed, and a strange confidence welled up within him. With his skills in hand, he was sure to achieve great things in this era full of opportunities!</p><p data-line="12" class="pr-line-array">"Hahaha..." <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p><p data-line="13" class="pr-line-array">"What's so funny?" <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="朱安">Zhu An</span> asked, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">puzzled.</span> "Let me see."</p><p data-line="14" class="pr-line-array">"Nothing, just remembered a joke." <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> brushed it off, but there was still an undisguised joy in her expression.</p><p data-line="15" class="pr-line-array">He immediately contacted <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="红后">Red Queen</span> in the group chat. <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">Dao</span> Xie: "Thank you, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="红后">Red Queen</span>."</p><p data-line="16" class="pr-line-array"><span class="text-patch system" data-hash="红后">Red Queen</span>: "You're welcome<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="气">.</span> I'd like to ask you, where did the program in the previous red envelopes come from?"</p><p data-line="17" class="pr-line-array"><span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> was naturally unaware of <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">Dao</span>; it was an automatic notification from the chat group.

Her online time was very unpredictable. <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> had wanted to ask her if the biohazard had broken out in her world yet, but she would have to wait until next time.</p><p data-line="22" class="pr-line-array">After closing the chat group, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span>'s mind immediately started racing. He now had the exploit patch and the mobile version of " <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="绝地求生：大逃杀">PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds: Battle Royale</span> " in his possession. What should he do with them?</p><p data-line="23" class="pr-line-array">The company that most desperately needs this patch is undoubtedly <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞公司">Bluehole Company</span>. <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞游戏公司">Bluehole Game Company</span> has suffered significant reputational and financial losses due to these vulnerabilities, which have led to the development of various <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="吃鸡">Chicken Dinner</span> cheats. They would certainly be interested in this.</p><p data-line="24" class="pr-line-array">The mobile version of <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="吃鸡">Chicken Dinner</span> is a knock-off that could surpass the original, and it's definitely a cash <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="利器">grab</span>. Many game companies would be vying for it, and my own company, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="死神游戏公司">Death God Game Company</span>, desperately needs it.</p><p data-line="25" class="pr-line-array">Sell ​​it to <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="死神游戏公司">Death God Game Company</span>? <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> hesitated. <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="死神游戏公司">Death God Game Company</span> hadn't treated him well<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">;</span> his internship there for several months was practically exploitation of his labor.</p><p data-line="26" class="pr-line-array">"Forget it, let's keep it business. I'll test the waters, and if it doesn't work out, then forget it," <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> thought to himself.</p><p data-line="27" class="pr-line-array">At noon, while eating, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> contacted the <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="华夏区">Huaxia Region</span> official of <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞游戏公司">Bluehole Game Company</span>.</p><p data-line="28" class="pr-line-array">"Hello, this is <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞游戏公司">Bluehole Game Company,</span> at your service." The sweet voice of customer service representative <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="妹子">Young Woman</span> came through the phone.</p><p data-line="29" class="pr-line-array">“Hello, I’m a programmer from <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="死神游戏公司">Death God Game Company</span>. I’d like to speak with your management about a potential collaboration,” <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">Lu</span> <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Zixin</span> said.</p><p data-line="30" class="pr-line-text">"Okay, please provide some information. After verifying your identity, I will report to my supervisor."</p><p data-line="31" class="pr-line-array">Before verification, customer service wouldn't easily trust <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span>, lest he be playing a prank.</p><p data-line="32" class="pr-line-array"><span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> provided some identification, and his employment information could be found online. Soon, the customer service representative, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="妹子">Young Woman,</span> transferred his call to a manager.</p><p data-line="33" class="pr-line-array">"Hello, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢先生">Mr. Lu</span>, my surname is Li, and I'm <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞游戏公司">from Bluehole Game Company."</span> "This is <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="张晓枫">Zhang Xiaofeng</span>'s secretary <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="华夏区">in Huaxia Region</span>. What can I do for you?" A male voice came from the other end of the phone.</p><p data-line="34" class="pr-line-array">“It’s like this, Secretary Li. I have a vulnerability patch for the game ‘ <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="绝地求生：大逃杀">PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds: Battle Royale</span> ’ here, and I think your company might need it…” <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> said.</p><p data-line="35" class="pr-line-array">On the other end of the phone, a man frowned. He thought it was something serious! It turned out to be just a bored guy. Ever since <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="绝地求生：大逃杀">PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds: Battle Royale</span> became popular, all sorts of people and companies have been asking for collaborations.</p><p data-line="36" class="pr-line-array">Good people want to invest in partnerships or become agents, while bad people want to maliciously take over their company. There are quite a few like this who think they've mastered some technology and want to sell it to their company for profit; some are even <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="黑客">hackers</span> who develop a cheat and try to extort them. He's seen far too many of them!</p><p data-line="37" class="pr-line-array">"I'm sorry, we appreciate your call, but we currently have no intention of cooperating." Secretary Li had no patience to listen to <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> continue. He was too busy to listen to anything about patches.</p><p data-line="38" class="pr-line-array"><span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> quickly said<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">,</span> "No, Secretary Li, I think you've misunderstood. This patch of mine can fix all the current vulnerabilities in your game, and it can prevent all those cheats circulating online!"</p><p data-line="39" class="pr-line-array">Secretary Li found it even more laughable after hearing this. Nobody knew how many cheats were currently being used in <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="吃鸡">Chicken Dinner</span>. The entire technical team at <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞公司">Bluehole Company</span> was at a loss, and a mere programmer could fix it? You must be joking!</p><p data-line="40" class="pr-line-array">Besides, this guy doesn't have any program data for " <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="绝地求生：大逃杀">PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds: Battle Royale</span>," so how did he create a vulnerability patch? He's definitely a scammer trying to swindle money.</p><p data-line="41" class="pr-line-array">Secretary Li's tone <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="气">had</span> completely lost its politeness<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="气">.</span> He said<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">,</span> "I'm sorry, I'm very busy right now. If you need anything, please call customer service."</p><p data-line="42" class="pr-line-array">"Wait, you don't have to believe me. I've already sent the improved game to your official email address. You can test it; it's definitely a bug-free version! Goodbye." <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> finished speaking and hung up the phone.</p><p data-line="43" class="pr-line-array">"You're insane!" Secretary Li cursed on the other end of the phone<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">,</span> "You're wasting my time."</p><p data-line="44" class="pr-line-array">He didn't believe a single word <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> said! It was simply impossible!</p><p data-line="45" class="pr-line-array">In fact, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> didn't expect to gain their attention this way. To sell the patch, he had to resort to some means—for example, hacking into their official email account.</p><p data-line="46" class="pr-line-array">While this method isn't exactly honorable, sometimes you have to be a little clever. After learning the "Programming Voice Skills Book" hidden in the red envelope, hacking into their official email account wasn't difficult for <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span>.</p><p data-line="47" class="pr-line-array">He quickly <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="突破">broke through</span> the firewall and secretly modified the official email account of <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞游戏公司">Bluehole Game Company</span>'s <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="华夏区">Huaxia Region</span>, making three hundred copies of his emails and adding special alerts to all of them.</p><p data-line="48" class="pr-line-array">The email contained a complete version of " <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="绝地求生：大逃杀">playerunknowns battlegrounds: battle royale</span>," which should have made the other party take it seriously.</p><p data-line="49" class="pr-line-array">After doing all this, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> felt much more relaxed. Now he just had to wait for <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="蓝洞游戏公司">Bluehole Game Company</span> to discover the improved version of the game and come to him, at which point he could raise the price and sell the vulnerability patch.</p><p data-line="50" class="pr-line-array">"How much should I sell it for? Three million? Five million? Or ten million? Something this good shouldn't be sold for less than a few million!" <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> thought to himself, his face beaming with joy, and he whistled happily.</p><p data-line="51" class="pr-line-array">" <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子">Lu Zi</span>, why are you so happy today? Did you win the lottery?" <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="朱安">Zhu An</span> asked <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">Dao</span>.</p><p data-line="52" class="pr-line-array">"No, I'm just in a good mood today." <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> really wanted to tell him what she had gained, but she suppressed the urge to show off.</p><p data-line="53" class="pr-line-array">"You have such a good attitude! My attitude at work is about to explode! I heard I have to work overtime again tonight, and there's no overtime pay, damn it!" <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">Zhu</span> <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="朱安">An</span> complained.</p><p data-line="54" class="pr-line-array">"Why work overtime if there's no overtime pay? No way!" Lu <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Zixin</span> said<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">.</span></p><p data-line="55" class="pr-line-array">“We have to keep working! What if we get fired?” <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="朱安">Zhu An</span> sighed<span class="text-patch system" data-hash="道">.</span> “It’s hard to find a job these days. We’ve been working for more than two months now. We’ll be officially hired after this month, so we just have to put up with it.”</p><p data-line="56" class="pr-line-array"><span class="text-patch system" data-hash="卢子信">Lu Zixin</span> had no intention of putting up with it any longer; he actually wanted to resign. However, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="丁雨">Ding Yu</span> hadn't come to work yet, and he planned to talk to <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="丁雨">Ding Yu</span> about it.</p><p data-line="57" class="pr-line-array">After all, <span class="text-patch system" data-hash="丁雨">Ding Yu</span> was practically his girlfriend, so they needed to discuss whether they should both resign.</p></div></span></div></div>
