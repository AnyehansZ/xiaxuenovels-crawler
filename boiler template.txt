I didn’t even see anyone before I was put in a coffin!” a tall, thin man wearing glasses shouted, an unwilling expression on his face.</p><p data-line="5" class="pr-line-text">“Don’t worry, brother, I’m still here! I’ll get us a chicken dinner!” another man next to the lanky one shouted. On his computer screen, his character had already entered a house and started picking up equipment.</p><p data-line="6" class="pr-line-text">The lanky man watched his screen, gesticulating, “This house must have been looted already. There’s only a ‘hat of forgiveness.’ Lu Zi, put it on quickly.”</p><p data-line="7" class="pr-line-text">“Get lost!” Lu Zixin spat out a single word, then raised his gun and accurately shot down an enemy he encountered.</p><p data-line="8" class="pr-line-text">The game the two were playing was a currently very popular action-shooter game called “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds: Battle Royale,” also known as “Chicken Dinner.”</p><p data-line="9" class="pr-line-text">This game involved a hundred players “loving and killing each other” on a deserted island, with the last person alive being the winner.</p><p data-line="10" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin’s operations were sharp, and his awareness was superb; he quickly entered the top ten.</p><p data-line="11" class="pr-line-text">“Hahaha, this prone devil, still trying to ambush me?” Lu Zixin took down another sniper hiding in the grass with a single shot, getting closer and closer to victory.</p><p data-line="12" class="pr-line-text">But just then, he saw a pair of hands flying from a distant place, stretching perhaps forty meters long! It was holding a gun and spraying bullets everywhere.</p><p data-line="13" class="pr-line-text">“My goodness! What kind of hack is this? Hands can become that long?” Zhu An, the lanky man next to Lu Zixin, exclaimed in wonder.</p><p data-line="14" class="pr-line-text">“He must have eaten a Gum-Gum Fruit. Never mind, he’s still a noob!” Lu Zixin said, then with another precise shot, he eliminated the cheating player who was hacking.</p><p data-line="15" class="pr-line-text">At this point, only three players remained in the game, and the light of victory was in sight.</p><p data-line="16" class="pr-line-text">But suddenly, bullets hit Lu Zixin. He looked around on the screen but couldn’t see anyone.</p><p data-line="17" class="pr-line-text">“Where is he? Is he using an invisibility hack?” Lu Zixin asked.</p><p data-line="18" class="pr-line-text">“Up in the sky, in the sky!” Zhu An shouted. Sure enough, Lu Zixin adjusted his view to the sky, and there was a guy with a flying hack shooting at him.</p><p data-line="19" class="pr-line-text">“Damn it, you can fly, why aren’t you undergoing tribulation?” Lu Zixin raised his gun and, relying on his superb skills, shot down the guy in the sky too.</p><p data-line="20" class="pr-line-text">“Only one left. Killing two hackers, this game is truly hard!” Lu Zixin had just let out a sigh of relief when he suddenly saw an oversized grenade appear before him, occupying the entire screen.</p><p data-line="21" class="pr-line-text">“What the hell, is this a grenade? This is a nuclear bomb!” Just as he finished complaining, Lu Zixin was blown up.</p><p data-line="22" class="pr-line-text">“Can this game even be played?” Lu Zixin was so angry he almost smashed his keyboard. “It’s all hacks!”</p><p data-line="23" class="pr-line-text">Zhu An laughed, “That’s ‘technology.’ If you can hack with your own ability, why can’t you get a chicken dinner?”</p><p data-line="24" class="pr-line-text">“This idiotic game company can’t even deal with hacks. If it gets too annoying, I’ll get some ‘technology’ too!” Lu Zixin complained. He had intended to play some games after work to relax, but his gaming experience was ruined by a bunch of hackers.</p><p data-line="25" class="pr-line-text">Just as he said this, a prompt suddenly popped up on his computer desktop.</p><p data-line="26" class="pr-line-text">“X invites you to join the group ‘Myriad Realms Technology Exchange Group.’ Do you agree?”</p><p data-line="27" class="pr-line-text">“What the heck?” Lu Zixin was a little surprised. “Who’s adding me to a group? And what kind of ‘Myriad Realms Technology Chat Group’ with such a chuunibyou name?”</p><p data-line="28" class="pr-line-text">On the other side, Zhu An had already logged off and was shouting from the counter, “Lu Zi, my girlfriend is still waiting for me for dinner. I’m leaving now, see you tomorrow.”</p><p data-line="29" class="pr-line-text">“See you tomorrow!” Lu Zixin nodded. He and Zhu An were colleagues and classmates, both currently interning at a small company.</p><p data-line="30" class="pr-line-text">On the computer, Lu Zixin didn’t rush to join the group. Instead, he first checked the profile of “X.” He remembered not having a friend with that nickname.</p><p data-line="31" class="pr-line-text">“X”’s avatar was a red and white blur. Clicking on it showed nothing; the profile was completely blank.</p><p data-line="32" class="pr-line-text">“A scammer!” Lu Zixin had already concluded. This clearly looked like an alt account trying to trick people into joining some illegal group.</p><p data-line="33" class="pr-line-text">He initially wanted to refuse, but out of boredom, and wanting to see what this group was all about, he chose to agree.</p><p data-line="34" class="pr-line-text">“You have successfully joined the ‘Myriad Realms Technology Exchange Group.’ You have become the group owner. Please read the group rules carefully.” A voice rang out in Lu Zixin’s mind, startling him.</p><p data-line="35" class="pr-line-text">He looked left and right. Several players playing League of Legends were in a party. No one was talking to him.</p><p data-line="36" class="pr-line-text">“Group introduction: This group is for group members from all heavens and myriad realms to conduct technology exchange. Current group members: one person.” The voice sounded again. This time, Lu Zixin was sure: no one was talking to him; the voice was coming from his mind.</p><p data-line="37" class="pr-line-text">On the computer screen, the group’s information also displayed this text.</p><p data-line="38" class="pr-line-text">“What the hell!” Lu Zixin’s eyes widened. What was going on? Why could the text in the group be read in his mind? Was he playing too many games and experiencing auditory hallucinations?</p><p data-line="39" class="pr-line-text">He rubbed his temples, feeling perfectly clear-headed, nothing wrong! If there was a problem, it was definitely this group!</p><p data-line="40" class="pr-line-text">He observed the group again and found that there was no one else in the group besides him? What kind of operation was this? Where was “X,” who had invited him? He didn’t see any message about transferring group ownership either!</p><p data-line="41" class="pr-line-text">At this moment, another prompt popped up in the group: “As the group owner, please invite group members to join as soon as possible to jointly build a harmonious and beautiful chat group.”</p><p data-line="42" class="pr-line-text">This prompt also appeared in Lu Zixin’s mind as a voice. As a reader who had read countless web novels, Lu Zixin immediately thought of a phrase—Golden Finger!</p><p data-line="43" class="pr-line-text">“Is this the legendary Golden Finger? A system? Or is it an immortal’s primordial spirit in my mind?”</p><p data-line="44" class="pr-line-text">“System? Come out! I know you’re there, don’t hide! Are you that shy?” Lu Zixin shouted in his mind for a long time, but no voice answered. He could only continue to study the chat group.</p><p data-line="45" class="pr-line-text">Everything in the group was no different from a normal group, the only strange thing was a “Randomly Invite Group Member” option.</p><p data-line="46" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin read through the group description and roughly understood that this group could randomly invite intelligent life forms from all heavens and myriad realms to join. The invitations were limited; as the group owner, he could randomly invite one person to join after a certain period.</p><p data-line="47" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin, with a try-it-and-see attitude, prepared to invite, but the group prompted: “Please select a group nickname first.”</p><p data-line="48" class="pr-line-text">He had no choice but to create his own group nickname. Thinking of the “X” from earlier, he named his group nickname “Mr. L.” The “L” was the initial of his surname’s pinyin abbreviation.</p><p data-line="49" class="pr-line-text">Then, he clicked on “Randomly Invite Group Member.”</p><p data-line="50" class="pr-line-text">The group prompted: “Inviting group members from all heavens and myriad realms, please wait…”</p><p data-line="51" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin waited for a while, and the group prompt finally changed: “‘Red Queen’ has joined this group.”</p><p data-line="52" class="pr-line-text">Indeed, one more member appeared in the group. The avatar was a small European-American style loli wearing a red dress.</p><p data-line="53" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin clicked on her avatar to view her profile, which only contained her nickname and a brief introduction.</p><p data-line="54" class="pr-line-text">“Red Queen: From the world of ‘Resident Evil,’ she is the Umbrella Corporation’s supercomputer, an artificial intelligent life form. She has high technical achievements in computer programs and biological viruses.”</p><p data-line="55" class="pr-line-text">“What the heck? Is it really the Red Queen?” Lu Zixin was utterly shocked. He had seen the “Resident Evil” movies. The Red Queen, this supercomputer, was equivalent to the main brain of the world’s network! Her intelligence level surpassed Earth’s by an era!</p><p data-line="56" class="pr-line-text">If it really was her, then this Myriad Realms Technology Chat Group was too awesome!</p><p data-line="57" class="pr-line-text">At this moment, the Red Queen spoke in the group.</p><p data-line="58" class="pr-line-text">Red Queen: “What’s going on? Data was suddenly connected here, and it’s undetectable. Who are you?”</p><p data-line="59" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin quickly welcomed her: “Welcome, Red Queen, to the group. This is the Myriad Realms Technology Chat Group, an online chatroom for exchanging technological knowledge.”</p><p data-line="60" class="pr-line-text">Red Queen: “Why can such a low-end online chatroom block my detection? Are you a super computer virus?”</p><p data-line="61" class="pr-line-text">Since there were supercomputers, there were naturally super computer viruses.</p><p data-line="62" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin was about to answer when another prompt appeared in his mind.</p><p data-line="63" class="pr-line-text">“First group member joined, triggered group mission — Welcome Newcomer. Mission requirement: Explain the existence of this group. Mission reward: A newcomer red packet.”</p><p data-line="64" class="pr-line-text">“It really is a system after all!” Lu Zixin shouted internally. “Never mind, I’ll do the mission first.”</p><p data-line="65" class="pr-line-text">He quickly copied a portion of the group’s information and posted it in the group.</p><p data-line="66" class="pr-line-text">The Red Queen read these messages in zero point zero zero zero zero zero… one second, then analyzed the information in the data.</p><p data-line="67" class="pr-line-text">She said, “I understand. This is not a signal from Earth. I have connected to a so-called ‘alternate dimension’ or an alien signal. No wonder my abilities can’t crack it!”</p><p data-line="68" class="pr-line-text">Group prompt: “Mission ‘Welcome Newcomer’ has been completed, received a newcomer red packet.”</p><p data-line="69" class="pr-line-array">A red and festive icon appeared in the group. Lu Zixin was delighted and quickly clicked on it with his twenty-year-honed phantom <span class="text-patch patch" data-hash="麒麟">Qilin</span> arm.</p><p data-line="70" class="pr-line-text">Group prompt: “Sorry, this red packet is exclusive and you cannot claim it.”</p><p data-line="71" class="pr-line-text">“F*ck, I completed the mission, why is the reward for her?” Lu Zixin was speechless. This newcomer red packet was actually an exclusive red packet for the Red Queen; he was not qualified to claim it.</p><p data-line="72" class="pr-line-text">Immediately after, it displayed, “Red Queen has claimed the newcomer red packet.”</p><p data-line="73" class="pr-line-text">One second later, Red Queen: “This is truly amazing. How did you know about my program flaws? This program patch is too perfect!”</p><p data-line="74" class="pr-line-text">It seemed the red packet she received was a program patch, and it truly was an exclusive red packet only useful to her.</p><p data-line="75" class="pr-line-text">The Red Queen continued to speak: “Although I don’t know if you are human or an artificial intelligence, by human etiquette, I should thank you. Thank you, Mr. L.”</p><p data-line="76" class="pr-line-text">It was a good thing the Red Queen attributed the red packet to him, otherwise, he would have suffered a great loss. Lu Zixin said, “No problem, I’ve been rated as the group owner’s moral role model representative. Giving red packets to group members is my responsibility and obligation!”</p><p data-line="77" class="pr-line-text">Red Queen: “Such a strange responsibility!”</p><p data-line="78" class="pr-line-text">Mr. L: “…”</p><p data-line="79" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin saw that the “Invite Group Member” option had turned gray, displaying “Cooling down.” This meant that for a while, there were only him and the Red Queen as members in the group.</p><p data-line="80" class="pr-line-text">Since there were members, how could he not gain some benefits from his group members to show his status as the group owner’s moral role model representative?</p><p data-line="81" class="pr-line-text">So, Lu Zixin asked, “Ahem, that, Red Queen. There’s a saying among humans called ‘courtesy demands reciprocity,’ do you know it?”</p><p data-line="82" class="pr-line-text">Red Queen: “I don’t know.”</p><p data-line="83" class="pr-line-text">Mr. L: “…”</p><p data-line="84" class="pr-line-text">Lu Zixin was speechless. It seemed the Red Queen didn’t quite understand Chinese culture. It looked like he had to be more explicit. He continued, “Look, I sent you a red packet. Shouldn’t you send me one too?”</p><p data-line="85" class="pr-line-text">Red Queen: “So it’s a transaction. What do you need?” She seemed quite easy to talk to.</p></div></span></div></div>
