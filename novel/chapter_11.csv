Sure enough, after the Red Queen read the message, she was puzzled : “What does this picture mean?”
She didn’t understand what expression (emoticon) package is, and the emoticon that Lu Zixin sent didn’t have any meaning. It’s just for fun, but there is no such record in the Red Queen’s data system.
Mr. L: “This is a popular way of communication in my world, and It’s more interesting to use pictures instead of text.”
Red Queen: “I see.”
She then sent another message, Lu Zixin read it, and it was actually an emoticon!
The emoticon is a blond girl in a red dress making a puzzled expression, next to it is the text, read : “Really? I don’t know about it, so don’t you dare lie to me!”
The image of the little girl is the avatar of the red queen, Lu Zixin was shocked. Red queen is using emoticon package? And still homemade? and again, where did it come from?
Lu Zixin made a shocked emoticon asked, “How can you use emoticon?”
Red Queen: “I am a super computer A.I with self-learning ability, and there is some related content in the information you sent to me last time. But at that time I set it a side as invalid information.”
Her message was followed by a cartoon rabbit sitting on the floor with the text next to it : “Obediently waiting to be praised.”
Lu Zixin is speechless. In the various information he sent the Red Queen last time, it was also mixed with the information of emoticon pack? So it was possible. It is just that, the learning ability of Red Queen is too strong. And in just a minute, from an innocent young creature (beginner) she became an emoticon pack madman. Not only did she use normal expressions (emoticons), but she is also able to make her own emoticon packs!
Mr. L: “You are amazing!”
Red Queen: “It’s interesting, is human beings expressing their emotions in this way? I want to try.”
Next, Lu Zixin and Red Queen continue to chat with him, and Red Queen has been asking questions about human emotions. According to her, she states that the biggest difference between humans, and artificial intelligence is that the thinking of humans is affected by their emotions.
She wants to try to “decipher” this emotion, and therefore perfect herself further.
The Red Queen is actually becoming addicted to emoticon package. As long as she sent a message it would be followed by an emoticon, if there weren’t any emoticon to use, she would make one herself.
Lu Zixin was not convinced at first and wanted to fight with her. But after a few rounds, he conceded defeat and then silently collected the Red Queen emoticon pack, hoping to fight  it out with other people next time.
Lu Zixin asked: “Red Queen, did the umbrella company’s T-virus already leaked?”
Red Queen became vigilant, and asked: “How do you know about the T virus? (emoticon: Say it, and I will let you live)”
Mr. L: “Umm. . . this is not convenient to explain, anyway, I know.”
Red Queen: “Although I feel that this strange place will not affect my world, according to the regulations of the Umbrella company, I can not disclose this information. (Expression (emoticon): I am wronged)”
Mr. L: “…Well, I asked too much.”
Red Queen: “The new experiment will start right now, so I am going to go offline now. (Expression (emoticon): Bai bai)”
Mr. L: “Bye.”
After the Red Queen went offline, a pop-up appeared in the window of the chat group: “The group activity was increased by 88 points, please keep up your good work!”
“Group activity?” Lu Zixin had not paid any of his previous attention to it, so he quickly went to check it out.
He found out that the current chat group activity log is 88/100. When the activity was enough to upgraded, the group owner will get a random red envelope. However, this red envelope is the same as the mission red envelope as it can only be sent to the group by Lu Zixin, and not for himself.
The ways to improve the activity log are to chat more, do more group tasks, and invite group members or the like.
This way, Lu Zinxin also understood that even if he is the group owner, it means nothing. Wasn’t his level too LOW? and wouldn’t it make it be more difficult to suppress the group members!
He had to improve the activity, with just a few random red envelopes in hand. He can sent it to the group members in the future, and when he asked for help, they will not be able to refuse his demands.
The next day,
Lu Zixin began the planning for the establishment of the company. He search around for information, and called some friends to ask those seniors who know something about the matter. In the afternoon, Lu Zixin mobile phone finally received a notification about the payment from the Blue Hole company.
“Your bank account with the number xxxx on the 16th of August, and 52 minutes and 43 seconds ago received 10,000,000 Chinese Yuan, your current balance in the account is 10,011,594 Yuan.”
“The 10 million is here!” Lu Zixin was ecstatic, and he even began to count the seven zero numbers several times! He can’t wait to yell to the sky. From now on, he also has an account with an eight-digit balance!
Lu Zixin would like to share this news to his parents and friends, although he will be suspected of showing off his wealth to his friends , even though he really wants to show off his wealth. It’s just that the money is going to be used for business, and it isn’t good to show off.
As for his parents, he must call them but there isn’t any need to say much, lest they start to worry.
Lu Zixin was calling his mother’s number, “Hello, Mom.”
“What’s wrong? are your living expenses are not enough?” the voice of Lu Zixin mother, Shen Man came through the phone.
Lu Zixin: “…”
“Mom, I am not calling to ask for living expenses. I am calling just to ask about the conditions there.” Lu Zixin emphasized, since he wanted to know if he could be of any help.
Shen Man: “Oh, there’s no trouble, everything is fine, I’m going to hang up.”
Oh mom, come on! Lu Zixin spoke in his heart, and he quickly said: “Don’t, I just wanted to tell you that my recent career is going good, so I have transferred 30,000 to your account.”
Shen man was amazed: “What !? Aren’t you just an intern? From where did you get that money?”
“Hey, recently I’ve have research a small software and made a fortune.” Lu Zixin said proudly.
“Not bad! It’s good news worth calling about!” Shen Man praised. “But you are just getting started, you don’t need to give us the money. You should save it for yourself, eat well, dress well, and then go looking for a girlfriend.”
“It’s nothing, I have enough money for myself.”
“You’re stupid! I heard you are still a single dog!” Shen Man said “Someone that has a girlfriend will never say this sentence in his life! How much is the consumption now?”
Lu Zixin: ” . . . *the heart received 10,000 in damages*!”
After chatting with his mother, Lu Zixin began to work on his business. The company registration process, and similar stuff weren’t something that cause a problem. The core of the company was the talent and products.
The product has already been ready but he lacks of people to implement it. It’s impossible for just Lu Zixin to operate the company alone, so it’s necessary to recruit other people.
The first person he thought of was Zhu An. Zhu An is his old classmate, his relationship with him is good, and he is also engaged in the same line of work. He was the most suitable choice.
Although Zhu An talent can only be said to be in the middle and not top-notch. But Lu Zixin needs such people in the early stage of the company. They need to satisfy two requirements, first is someone you can trust, and second is someone that can help you improve the basic structure of the company as soon as possible.
He immediately sent a message to Zhu An, and did not make any roundabout arguments, directly explaining his intention, and invited him come out to eat at night.
At this time, Zhu An was still working and saw the message notification from WeChat, and he was shocked to say the least.
He replied in secret: “Lu Zixin, do you want to start a business? Really?”[FOR REALS]
Lu Zixin: “Of course it’s true!”
Zhu An: “Brother, this is not a joke! I think your decision is a little too impulsive, now that you have made money, why don’t you buy a nice suite and wait for it to appreciate in value. There is no need to start a business. If you start a business now, it ‘s Nine Deaths, No Life!”
Lu Zixin: “Let’s talk about it tonight.”
