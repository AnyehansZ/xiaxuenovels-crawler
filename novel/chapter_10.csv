TL note: Ten Thousand Realms Science and Technology Chat Group >>> Black Technology Chat Group
This condition, if was Lu Zixin from before he got the Black Technology Chat Group, he would of been very excited and even agree to it immediately.
But now, his mentality is very different. Now that he has a super computer program Red Queen in his group, and there will definitely be more magical characters in the future, and thus giving him more help.
At that time, would I still need to work for others? what a waste of time!
So Lu Zixin smiled and said: “Sorry, I have no plans to work yet.”
Zhang Xiaofeng did not expect to be successful in one try. He said: “It doesn’t matter, our company is always welcoming to talents such as Mr. Lu.”
Some details of the contract still need to be negotiated, and it is not possible for the money to arrive immediately. This process will take several days at minimum.
That night, when Lu Zixin asked Zhu An to eat, he casually talk a bit and it’s made Zhu An to admire him.
“Too awesome! Is there such an case?” Zhu An couldn’t believe it that the man in front of him, was the very same old classmate Lu Zixin. He wouldn’t be a different person wearing his skin, right?
“So, the Blue Hole company spent millions to buy your stuff?”
“Almost.” Lu Zixin did not say that it was 10 million, because it would become a little more troublesome.
“Darn, so envious! Yesterday, we are on the streets together. Today you will become a local tyrant!” Zhu An was very emotional. “No, this meal must be your treat.”
“Then don’t order this dish, change to a potato!” Lu Zixin said in a serious tone.
Zhu An give him his erected middle finger, but he also knew that Lu Zixin was joking.
“You didn’t see it, today after you have gone, Qin Zhijie face was black all day!”
Lu Zixin said in disdain: “That person is too greedy, he actually wants money from me, of all people!”
“Haha, that right, don’t let him get a single penny!” said Zhu An as he smiled. “The supervisor also got a beaten today.”
“Dogs will bite dogs.”
“Right, Ding Yu is still asking me about your business, what do you want me to say?” Zhu An asked.
“Whatever.” Referring to Ding Yu, Lu Zixin drank a glass of wine.
“OK! You see, she still does not regret it, even she dies, she would not be willing to follow you!” Zhu An said with bad taste, and told Lu Zixin the situation about Ding Yu.
Ding Yu messages went back a few times, and then silent. He didn’t know what she was thinking.
After a while, Lu Zixin phone rang, he look at the caller ID and found out it was Ding Yu.
Lu Zixin glanced at it, hung it directly after, and then blocked the number.
Over the phone, Ding Yu saw that the phone was hung up, and that the number could not be dialed, her mood was extremely complicated. Regret accompanies unwillingness.
What she regretted is that she actually missed the chance to make it, but made the wrong choice. She was unwilling to be compared with Lu Zixin, although the two had not determine their relationship before. But she still had a feeling that “she will have a better life than the Ex.”
“Didn’t you just make a fortune? If you don’t have the ability you will change back to your original state, Qin Zhijie is better than him!” Ding Yu comforted herself. Like what Qin Zhijie said before, just wait for company’s mobile chicken (pubg mobile) to go on to the online market, it will definitely make a hefty profit!
After Lu Zixin and Zhu An finished their meal, Lu Zixin returned to his rental apartment. After he washed, he went to lay in his bed and meditated on the past experiences.
The contract with the Blue Hole Company had been signed, and that 10 million according to Lu Zixin supplementary conditions, is 10 million after tax. For most individuals it’s a lot of money!
Wait until he gets the ten million, what should he do then? Just eat and while waiting to die? This is definitely not what Lu Zixin wants to do.
He now has advanced programming language skills, and it’s not a problem to go to a large company, such as the invitation from the Blue Hole.
Lu Zixin wasn’t reconciled with that idea though, and there is an “artifact” like the Black Technology Chat Group, if he was willing to work for others, then he would be wasting a huge opportunity, right?
“I should start my own business!” The idea came to Lu Zixin’s mind, as it’s quickly sprouted, it became unstoppable. In today’s world, no matter the enterprise or the country, only with the mastery of high-tech can he stand at the top!
Regardless of the big picture, just from the business picture, there are several large technology giants in China, which not only create various advanced technology products, but also create rich mans on the rich list!
Big foreign technology companies can influence the world! A major decision and invention from them can make the world change!
Beside, this world is very supportive for the development of technology companies, such as China, there are regulations that protect the technology, and created various facilities to ensure it. Moreover, the influence of those companies is equally huge.
“I want to be a technology giant on this planet! Beyond the domestic giants, even the top companies in the world!” Lu Zixin had made up his mind, he is a man with ambition, desire and bottom line.
He likes money, likes beauty, and likes to be admired, but he also has a bottom line. He doesn’t want to kill and set fire, but to achieve it with real strength, for example, to create a company!
After having an active goal to pursue, Lu Zixin felt that this whole body was in high spirits, and could not wait to get up and start working.
“Calm down, calm.” Lu Zixin took a deep breath, now that he has a goal to pursue, he now needs to think of  how to achieve it.
Creating a company is simple to say and hard to do. As the saying goes, 10,000 people start a business, and 9,999 people will be thrown into the streets.
However, Lu Zixin has convenience Black Technology Chat Group that can facilitate the technology sector, giving him a lead to start ahead on. As long as the operation is good, success is not difficult thing.
“Right now, in my case, the creation of a black technology company, is nonsense.” Lu Zixin thought to himself, just with his ten million alone, he wants to engage in industrial technology, that is wishful thinking.
With his money he can’t afford large-scale equipment, so according to his own advantages, it’s still necessary to take on the Internet technology first, the starting cost is low but the results are fast.
Lu Zixin had been working in a game company before, so he knows this very well. In addition, he also has eat chicken (fps/tps pubg-like) mobile game that’s can be put into operation, as a starting point, so he decided to set up a game company.
Now he has played many versions of eat chicken mobile (pubg) in the market. so he can be sure that this eating chickens game (this fps/tps or pubg-like) from Red Queen is better than any of them, regarding the game optimization! The Red Queen still improved the game according to the current mobile phone configuration and conditions, so he has multiple versions of it.
In this way, there will be no incompatibility between different brands and system phones. When it’s released, it will definitely be recognized by the players as one of the best games.(editor: I put one of the… because if you could play some PC games in your smart phone, and it plays just as good or better you would definitely do it)
“It’s decided.” Lu Zixin thought to himself, “Tomorrow I will begin the planning for the establishment of the company.”
As for now, of course group harmony! What is the difference between a group of people who are not in harmony and a salted fish?
Lu Zixin quickly opened the Black Technology Chat Group. He first checked the button for the inviting group members and it’s still showed cooling time.
In the group, Red Queen avatar status is displayed online. Lu Zixin quickly sent an expression (emoticon) with the text “is there anyone here? Come out there’s a work!”
