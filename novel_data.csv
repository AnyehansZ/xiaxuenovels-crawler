MEMORIZE,"Chapter 1 Zero Code, 10 years back.  ========================================================================= 1. Name : Kim Soo-hyun (10 years) 2. Class : General Inspection (Normal, Sword User, Master) 3. Nation: Terra 4. Organizations (Clan): – 5. Real name and nationality: a person who cares about the world and wants to be reclusive, normal, South Korea 6. Gender (Sex): Men (33) 7. Height · Weight: 181.5 cm · 75.5 kg 8. Propensity: Order and Chaos (The residual capability point is 0 point.)  I can’t think of anything. Just in a daze, I roll a small bead in my left hand. “User Kim Soo-hyun.” Ten years. I’ve achieved what I’ve aspired and dreamed so much for that long time. However, it still does not disappear. The sense of loss that fills me now and the painful heart that fills me was still bothering me. “User Kim Soo-hyun. May I ask you one more time?” A gentle but beautiful voice knocks on my ear. Attracted by the sound, I slowly raised my head. As I looked up, I saw a floor made of gray bricks. Then, when 30 pyeong of space was captured in view, the eyes that had been going up gradually stopped. On the rectangular altar in the center of the room, a room of summons that marks the beginning of everything, and ends everything, the wings that sprayed white were dimly fluttering. I fixed my eyes on the ‘angel’ sitting on the altar feeling empty. “I will reconfirm the user’s request. Do you really want to turn back Hallplane’s time?” “Yeah.” Slowly nod and stare at the angel in front of you. Beautiful appearance that can be called the peak of beauty, smooth skin that shows no sign of beauty, and close clothing that reflects the skin at first glance. The whole thing was looking only at me. But there is no desire. The beautiful appearance of an angel, the affectionate eyes. Nothing shook my already dead heart. I’ve lost all my emotions since that day. “I’m not convinced at all. All angels, including me, don’t understand you.” “No, you’re wrong. I’m not asking for your understanding. Seraph.” My voice in my ear, it’s so refreshing. Seraf’s voice, an angel, was shaking unusually thin. I have never seen Seraf agitated except today. Does that mean what I just said is that shocking? Although he appeared briefly agitated, Seraf immediately recovered his expressionless impression. And he started to talk to me calmly in a polite voice. “User Kim Soo-hyun, you are the first user to achieve all of the missions of Hallplane and win the top prize.” “But.” “But that’s not the case by the way. I got the zero code that I had hoped for so much. You have a ‘qualification’. Within the ‘qualification’ permission, we can achieve everything we want.” “Seraf, we’re done talking.” “Return to Earth? All right. You can return to Earth while maintaining your current abilities. Stay in the hallplane? That’s good, too. With the Zero Code, you could be the king of all continents, or more.” I sighed and held my right hand around my waist, as I thought it would never stop. The handle of the sword that came into my grasp felt familiar. “Huyu, 10 years is enough to fall for such sweet talk. Now I’m tired. Seraf? I won’t tell you any more. No matter what words you use to seduce me, I won’t be reconsidering the use of zero code.” Hold the handle until it crumbles and create mana along the circuit. Seraph shut her mouth at once, as if she had read the rising energy from my whole body. But that was also for a while. Soon the feeling of pity on her face when she saw me was colored. He doesn’t seem to be willing to give up persuasion yet. “The ownership of Zero Code lies solely with the user Kim Soo-hyun. We are not authorized to touch it. That’s why it’s so sad. It’s absurd to simply use that great power to turn back time.” “…….” “I’ll confirm for the last time. Does the user Kim Soo-hyun really want to repeat the painful 10 years?” Seraf’s tone of voice was now almost like a plea. Suddenly, a reasonless laughter burst out from the inside. This was literally a laugh for no reason. I laughed silently for a while. * This is not the earth. Another world called “Hall Plain,” where everyday life is different from everyday life enjoyed by modern people.  I closed my eyes gently. And I started looking back on what I’d been through one by one. When I first entered Hallplane, I was still 23 years old when I had a great future. When I think of my last memory on Earth, all I can think of is a pleasant return home after two years of military service. On his way home from the military service report, he fell asleep on the train, and when he came to his senses, he was summoned to the “room of summons” right here. And in front of my sober eyes was an angel with white wings that existed only in my imagination. A situation in which nothing was known, and nothing was known. It was literally a bolt out of the blue for me, who had been in a dream of finally going back home. It wasn’t a dream, it wasn’t an imagination. I begged the angel to send it back when it was barely accepted as a reality. But the next place I was moved to was a place that proved the user’s qualifications, called the rite of passage. I was forced to take a test there, chased by monsters I’d never seen before. The designated test period is seven days. It was only a battlefield for survival. It was only after barely enduring a week of life threats that I was able to qualify as a “user” to enter the world of “hole plane.” But the rite of passage was not the end. Hallplane was the real beginning. If the rite of passage was a seven-day survival war, Holplain was a hell of no promise when he would die. And life in Hall Plain that began. I just wanted to live. Because I wanted to live, I desperately adapted to the absurd world of Holplain. I put all my hopes on the angel’s word that I could go back when I reached the end, and I have been active for 10 years. Yeah, I just wanted to live and go back. With my unbreakable friends. “User Kim Soo-hyun. What are you thinking about? Do you have any idea….” As soon as I think of the word “fate,” I feel emotional. I shook my head hard. The important thing now was that I wasn’t lost in reflection. “Oh, it reminded me of the old days. By the way, it’s a painful repeat of 10 years.Seeing you say that, I guess you have at least a conscience?” “…….” “Right, thanks to you, I’ve experienced pain that I didn’t need to suffer. That’s for as long as 10 years.” “User Kim Soo-hyun.” Seraf’s eyes look all over me, trying to read the hearing. Just as she was about to say quit, her beautiful lips open and a quiet voice comes out. “If you’re thinking about Kim Yoo-hyun and Han So-young…I think I know what you want. User Kim Soohyun. I have a very reasonable idea. Currently, your GP has accumulated enough points to trigger your wish over and over again. You don’t have to use zero code to go back to the past….” I hate to admit it, but he was right.’ I knew that word would come out. Even before Seraf’s words, I pulled a knife from the sheath and swung it with all my might. Ping! A sharp piercing sound that tears the air out. The waves I sent shook the altar where Seraf sat. But that’s all. The waves on her white shield dissipated into thin air. “User Kim Soo-hyun…I understand how you feel, but it’s pointless. I think you’re probably aware of that.” I know anyway. The user cannot harm the angel. But what I wielded was an expression of strong will that I would never change my will. “Just before Astarot died, he said, After all, you’re the same Yeon-doo.” “Are you going to believe the devil? Not anyone else, but you?” “That’s the truth. I can’t do this or that. After all, the conclusion doesn’t make much difference.” “Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.. I think I’ve already explained enough about your requirements.” “You said you weren’t qualified. You said you can’t because you don’t deserve it. So I’ve gone so far as to turn back time and try to qualify again, what’s so frustrating about that?” “Suhyun!” Ping! Ping! “Don’t scream, I’m not deaf. And call the last name with the user. Just like you always did.” Again the waves blew away and died down. Seraf was staring at me with a sad look to see if he could believe this unexpected behavior. I don’t care. I fixed the sword, which was aiming at her, that gleaming bluster. And as soon as he breathes all his mana, the dark flames begin to rise little by little from the sword’s Seraf, who looked at the end of the sword, bit his lips tightly. “I’d like to warn you one last time. Remove the sword right now. No matter how much setup you can use, your source is human. If you think you can kill someone with a distant class, I’d say it’s a mistake.” “Really? Then shall we test it out? I’ll just throw it all away and ask the Zero Code to give me the power to kill you.” “Definitely, you have permission to use it. However, the trigger of the zero code must go through us unconditionally. I hope you wake up from your dreams.” “You’re confident. Is there any way?” “Su….User Kim Soo-hyun.Ha…. It’s a meaningless argument. But….” Seraf rattled his mouth as if he wanted to say something more. However, he soon closed his lips, feeling the cold anger and genuine emotion rising on the sword.  “…….” “…….” For a moment, there was a heavy silence between me and Seraf. I calmed down the boiling excitement and slowly lowered the sword. And in a lonely mood, I listened to the Zero Code in my left hand. A small, pretty bead of blue light. What the hell is this…. “Seraf, I don’t want to fight anymore, I don’t want to talk anymore. If you understand how I feel, and if you really think about me. Please.” As soon as I brought up the word “please,” Seraf’s eyes, which were soaked in sorrowfully, turned round. I held out my hand holding the zero code at her. It is now firmly determined. “I’ll ask you one more time. I want to go back 10 years. When I first came in here, back in those days.” Have you read my earnest will? At that moment, the zero-code, which used to shine between horses, begins to emit a group of bright lights. I opened my hand wide, which I had been holding calmly. Then the glowing sphere came to mind and flew to the altar where Seraf was located, drawing a thin parabola. She accepted the sphere with a blank face. Seraf’s empty gaze soon encountered the gaze I was sending and complicated in the air. How long has it been since we saw each other like that? Soon her lips opened slowly, very slowly. “If you really want it.” “…….” “I respect your opinion.” “Seraf.” Seraph stared at me, and continued with a look of no energy. “Don’t get me wrong and listen. As I said before, the user Kim Soo-hyun currently has a significant number of GPs. It’s not reasonable to get rid of it as it is.” I shook my head left and right at Seraf’s words. We’re going back anyway, so what’s the use of Gold Point = GP now? But whether Seraf’s idea was different, she was manipulating her hand at an invisible pace. “It’s unbelievable, but your will has caused a zero-code reaction. All right, with the authority of the helper, we’ll adjust the details arbitrarily. Of course, there will be nothing more harmful to the user, Kim Soo-hyun. I’ll see you soon after the work is done.” You’re done? See you soon? I was about to ask you what you were up to when you said something you didn’t understand. Just as I was about to take off my lips, a loud voice filled the room of summoning that I had never heard before. “We received a request from the user, Kim Soo-hyun. 27%, 58%, 77% 100%. Loading…. Approval complete. Passed. Notify Code Name, Zero right now. Please be ready.” Nodding, nodding. At that moment, I heard a rusty machine moving somewhere. At the same time, the Zero Code, which entered Seraf’s arms, scattered through the air with clear light. Paaa! Light that is bright enough to fill the view is colored inside. Still, there was a rusty mechanical sound, and a strange sense of indescribability swept through the body quickly. It’s not unfamiliar. The sense of space twisting, and the sense of something passing by quickly. It was similar to the sense that the world was distorted when the Great Prince of Hell appeared in the Atlanta recapture war the other day. It is hidden by a group of lights that grows stronger as time goes by, and it is no longer visible. In time, I closed my eyes tightly in a way that I could. ============================ Review of the work ============================ 1. Modify User Information Window. 2. Add zero code trigger conditions and content. 3. Typing and contextual correction."
MEMORIZE,"Chapter 2 Zero Code, 10 years back.  ========================================================================= When I felt the light that had been patting my eyelids constantly was getting weaker, I opened my eyes gently, which had been closing. The lights that filled the entire room were fading away, leaving only a slight glow. When I blinked once or twice, the blurry view gradually became the focus. Soon as I recovered to the point where I could judge things, I calmly began to look around. It’s different. I was just closing my eyes for a while, but a lot had changed. The knife in his right hand and the equipment he was wearing were all gone. As I lowered my eyes from my empty hands, I saw a military uniform with a stain on it. And as soon as I saw the buoy attached to my left chest, I stopped breathing for a moment. It was then. “Check for Code Name Zero. Complete. Zero code activation. We confirmed normal operation. User Kim Soo-hyun, congratulations.” When I raised my head with a familiar voice, I could see Seraph still sitting on the altar looking at me. And at that moment, I was a little frowned upon. Her physical condition was severe enough to show that she was not normal at first glance. “Why do you think so?” The beautifully fluttering white wings were dimmed beyond sight, and the entire body was translucent, reflecting the back without filtration. Only the impolite face remained the same as before. Keeping quiet, Seraf tilted his head and said. “It’s been a long time since I’ve received your worried eyes. But that’s all right. It is Thursday, December 27, 2011 Earth time. At your request, Kim Soo-hyun of Earth has returned to the time when he first entered the summoning room. Again, the user’s request has been successfully processed and completed.”  “Yes…. I see. So Seraf, are you back with me?” As soon as he opened his mouth, Seraf shook his head slowly from side to side. “I can’t tell you exactly, but I’ll say no for now. I asked Zero Code for deterrence for a very short time because there was something left to explain to the user Kim Soo-hyun. The Zero Code accepted my request, fortunately, if it considered my opinion valid.” “Do you have anything to explain?” “Yes, I am.” Still frowning around his eyes, Seraf replied with a rather gentle smile. It was the first angel smile I’ve seen in a decade on Hall Plain. The sudden but refreshing feeling of approach made me unwind my frown. The awkward atmosphere subsided for a while. But it wasn’t me who opened the door first, it was Seraf. She swept her silvery white hair behind her ears, half-closed her eyes and quietly opened her mouth. “I remember the day when user Kim Soo-hyun was first summoned to Hallplane. Do you remember the first thing you said when you saw me?” “I don’t know.” You can’t remember that. I don’t know what kind of ghost you’re trying to say, but I decided to listen to it silently. Seraf has always been a “helper” person, at least in terms of giving adequate advice. “Hey, where are we? “Huh? You, who are you?” “Oh, by the way, stuttering? You remember everything.” “Hu-hoo. Not just this isn’t it. Other than that….” I’m fired! At that moment, there was a sound of space tearing apart, and Seraf’s whole body, which was continuing a ridiculous story, was greatly twisted. It looked like a miscellaneous signal when a poor connection was turned on. “Ugh!” Twist, then go back to normal. Seraf groaned in pain. The more repeated the phenomenon, the more translucent it was. Her appearance seems so unfamiliar. Once you close and open your eyes, you will have the original calm attitude, but now Seraph in front of you was looking dangerous like a lantern in front of the wind. As the noise died down in time, Seraph, who managed to recover, showed a bitter look. “I don’t think it’s going to be acceptable to Zero Code. But we’ve been together for 10 years…I don’t even allow time to share my feelings of parting.” I can’t get used to it. In the past, I would have gone straight to the point rather than saying that. As Seraph said, angels are always a reasonable race. I couldn’t get used to seeing him suddenly change after seeing his consistent attitude for 10 years. “Yes, then I’ll explain it quickly and finish it.” Eventually, I snapped back curtly. Seraf stared at me with sad-looking eyes and then continued with a short sigh. “User Kim Soo-hyun has consumed very little GP since the middle of the game. I’m going to give you some perks to start over with some of the points you’ve earned.” “Huh? The perks?” “Of course, I’ll leave the rest of the GP.” “Because it’s a privilege… I don’t know what it is, but you treat me as much as you’ve seen it once. I’m so grateful for this that I’m crying.” It was a tone full of sarcasm, but Seraf shook his head slightly as if it was not. “I’d appreciate it if you thought it was a favor rather than a treatment. All angels, including me, fully understand, sympathize with and sympathize with your feelings.”  “Pity? Hahaha….” “I apologize if the word “sympathy” sounded offensive. I didn’t mean to demean you. However, at least in the hallplane, angels are responsible for helping users. Have I ever given any advice to the user Kim Soo-hyun that would sound harmful? Think about it carefully. I’ll leave it entirely up to the user Kim Soo-hyun to accept this favor or let it go.” He said he would leave it entirely to me, but Seraf was not giving him any room to refute, as if he were trying to somehow make him receive a “privilege.” What’s more, I couldn’t think of anything to say even though I tried to push it further here, so I nodded in a shudder mood. “It’s a great choice. I have no doubt that this choice will make what Kim Soo-hyun is trying to accomplish easier.” As soon as he agreed, Seraf smiled with a more relieved look. And now almost invisible, the faint wings flapped vigorously once. Soon the distance between her and me decreased rapidly, and soon I felt a soft touch over my head. Gently raised his eyes, Seraph continued in a relaxed voice. “I don’t want to, but I hope you’ll hang in there. We don’t have much time left. I will enter and deliver the contents directly into my head.” At the end of Seraf’s words, there was a flashing shock on the top of her head. It doesn’t hurt. Rather curiously, the information Seraf was clearly coming into his head. With my eyes closed, I calmly savored the information she gave me. 1. User Kim Soo-hyun will be given a special privilege regarding the capability information he originally had. First, you can ‘load’ the user information you achieved in the first round. Second, randomly select four of the six basic capability information and raise the number. The degree of increase in the number is also determined at random. 2. Grant perks on the class. You can determine the class in advance before entering the rite of passage. You can select all classes wrapped in secrets, including Rare and Secret classes, as well as generic classes. 3. Grant special and potential capabilities perks. Users will generally have one special ability slot and four potential slots, but we will open another potential slot for Kim Soo-hyun. It also opens up both special and potential capabilities, including hidden capabilities, and allows you to choose what you want. And the other way, you can open up a slot called ‘unique ability’. A unique ability is a capability that is above a special ability. If you give up your own ability, you can choose all 5 special abilities as your own (open slots automatically include your own potential). However, if you choose to have unique capabilities, you can consume one potential and choose only half of the remaining four slots as your desired capability (the remaining two are random). 4. Only once, you can undergo a physical modification procedure. 5. User Kim Soo-hyun can select one equipment he wants, and there is no restriction on the type. However, you cannot select EX grade equipment. Information about the perks that fill your head without giving you a break. When I opened my eyes in a complicated mood, I could see Seraph, who had only a vague remnant. She still hasn’t removed her hands from the top of her head, but she doesn’t feel the same way anymore. After barely finishing organizing the information entered, I burst into a quiet exclamation. “This is….” To be honest, I had never dreamed of granting such a privilege, so I was a little puzzled. If we could really start with these perks, it was a start like using character editing before starting the game. Seraf said with a slight smile that he read my countenance. “These perks were made with the points earned by the user Kim Soo-hyun. Of course, I won’t deny that some of my favors are mixed. But it doesn’t matter at all because all the angels agreed.” “I like it, but you’ll be gone soon anyway. Wouldn’t it be restricted by balance?” “That’s not true. And I felt a little bit of pride in the way Kim Soo-hyun spoke. I’ve been telling you this for 10 years. Never let your guard down under any circumstances.” “I’ll be careful. No, but balance is the problem. Think about it. What would you think if a newcomer was given this privilege and started?” “You don’t have to worry about that because Tanay can solve it. And balance is…Of course, I did think about balance, but….” Ceraf, who stopped talking for a while, began to read my mind. Then, he carefully continued with a hesitant voice. “Considering the potential of the original user, Kim Soo-hyun, we can say that this was balanced.” Seraf’s words had many implications, but I could understand what they meant immediately. In fact, ‘potentiality’ is the most important key to determining ‘user information’. I can understand the meaning of Seraf, but why does it taste bitter in my mouth? No matter what anyone says, I’m the only user to reach the top of Hallplane. I do not intend to deny that it has risen based on numerous miracles and coincidences. But isn’t there an old saying like that, too. The strong one doesn’t survive. The strong one survives. Speaking of general strength, I could confidently say that I was strong. Of course, I know that I can’t name the best and the best. But no matter how much…. “…Phew.” “Don’t be arrogant. Don’t let your guard down.” In the end, I think this is what Seraf wanted to say. I really felt embarrassed, as she said, if I had felt arrogant. I sighed briefly and nodded. Anyway, it wasn’t wrong. Although his pride was a little hurt, he immediately calmed down when he saw Seraph, who had faded almost beyond recognition. “Now…, I’m really going to break up…”.Time….” As Seraf said, it seems that the end has come. She was twisting around like a TV screen just before it broke down. It is now not even recovering to its original state. That, I just couldn’t help looking at it. “Goodbye…” You…I’ve always wanted to…There is.” I can’t hear Seraf more and more. Her presence is slowly fading away. Still, Seraf was telling me enough to be desperate. “He’s….really..”  “Seraf, I’m a little sorry to say this until the end, but I can’t hear you.” But if you can hear what I’m saying, Seraf’s face is filled with sadness. But there’s nothing I can do in this situation. It was a situation I hoped for in the first place, and it was also self-inflicted. But she didn’t give up. “Boo….Dee….” Pot! The noise seemed to be getting worse, and suddenly the white light flashed with a pod. Glowing lights appeared around Seraf and disappeared in an instant. Now that it’s really coming to an end, she chews on her lips. And I thought I was putting strength in my eyes, and my lips slowly fell off. “Please be happy…”.” Softly…. With that being said, Seraph disappeared. No more noise occurs. But the last words she uttered with all her might have been heard. At the last minute, I felt like I was smiling at myself, but I couldn’t take a closer look at it because I was focusing on my words. For a very short time, I stared at Seraf’s spot. ============================ Review of the work ============================ 1. Delete the reminiscence about Kim Yoo-hyun. 2. Delete the contents of Hallplane and Kim Soo-hyun. 3. Typing and contextual correction."
MEMORIZE,"Chapter 3 Seraf, embarrassed.  ========================================================================= I turned back 10 years of time years. Seraph, who had been with him for 10 years, disappeared. So what’s going to happen now??’ It’s empty now, but an angel will soon be summoned onto the altar. A new angel could come out or Seraph could come out again. It doesn’t matter if it’s the former, but what happens if it’s the latter? I can guess that he will forget all the memories he had with me, but I was still curious about it. When I waited for about three minutes, I felt a reaction. The space on the altar began to flutter like waves. I would have lost my mind by this time in the first round. I watched the altar with keen interest, as I had never seen an angel summoned before. White light emanates from the center of the ripple, which was spreading through concentric circles, like waves on the surface. The light seemed to fly for a moment, but soon it exploded brightly like a firecracker and began to form a shape. I watched the whole process of creating a new angel. Soon there was an angel who had been created on the altar. His eyes were still closed, but the figure felt so familiar. Flashing wings with holy spirit. a radiance of dignity and noble colors that dare not be overtaken The angel, who appeared, looked exactly the same as Seraf. Seraf’s eyes slowly open to see if he felt my eyes. In a short moment, Lee Chae passed by her light green eyes facing me. Beautiful, noble. Seraf, like angels in novels and cartoons, had a charm that was filled with indescribable stillness and holy energy.  The silvery white hair, which shone as if it had been moonlighted, was shiny as silk. The skin is so white that it reminds me of white eyes and boasts fine skin without blemishes. Light double eyelids glistened with jade eyes in them. And even the skin showing at first glance. However, the fine figure does not give rise to a single desire, let alone insults. Since they are on a different level in the first place, they will feel differently about each other. I could feel Seraf’s gaze as if I were surprised to be awake. Scrub every inch of me with calm eyes to see if I’m observing. As always, I felt her looking at me, so I could be sure. Seraph, it’s you from ten years ago. At that moment, Seraf’s fine lips opened. “Nice to meet you.” “Yes.” “Welcome to the summoning room. Planet Earth. From South Korea. 23 years old. Name: Kim Soohyun. Your authentication is complete. From now on, I will call Kim Soo-hyun a user for convenience. I’m Seraf, your guide in the future.” “Yes.” “User Kim Soo-hyun will be moved to a place called the rite of passage after giving basic knowledge in this summoning room. And you have to prove your qualifications to be a true user there.” “Yes.” “…….” Seraf, who was talking at a fast pace, shut up. She tilted her head with a look of ‘This isn’t it’. When I saw Seraph like that, I felt a little bit fresh. But I’ll have to get what I’m getting. “I have a question….” “If you’re asking me where I am right now and why I’m here, I recommend you not to. There are only two hours left before entering the rite of passage. Of course, I understand that the current situation is confusing. But if you want to live, and if you want to go back….” Seraf may have thought it was right, but he started firing like a fast-fire again. Although I’m somewhat used to it now, I was honestly quite scared at first. I felt like I saw a ghost when I spoke in a calm tone and a face without expression. When I remembered that time, I laughed for no reason. After a smirk, I replied calmly. “Oh, yeah.” “Users are encouraged to devote a given amount of time to adapting to their situation as much as possible….” “Okay, okay.” “…….” Seraf’s forehead was slightly frowned upon despite his submissive acceptance. As if her hands were slowly floating in the air, she murmured, blinking three or four times. “I’m not a psychopath.I’m in a very stable state of mind. It’s unusual.” “A psychopath at anyone’s disposal…Anyway, it doesn’t matter. Seraf, aren’t you comfortable following what you say?” “That’s true.” “That’s enough. What are you complaining about?” “I didn’t complain. Anyway, good. User Kim Soo-hyun’s attitude is very desirable. If we can maintain that attitude in the future, the survival rate will rise dramatically. So first of all….” This time I completely raised my hand. Seraf finally saw my signal and stopped talking again. “I said I had a question.”  “Is that right, that’s great. As long as it doesn’t apply to what I said earlier, I’ll allow you to ask me specifically.” “That’s not it. Do you have anything for me?” “You mean something to give? I don’t understand the clear meaning of the question. I need a little more detail.” “Well, I heard you can call me Tanay.” “!” The moment I said Tanay, I could see Seraf agitated visibly. I knew this would happen. The reaction is interesting, but I was a little worried that I might not receive it. You can’t give up the privilege. I spoke in a gentle tone, thinking that I would accept it once I forced myself to do so. “Tanay, I’m sure you said Tanay. It’s good to start out however you want, but you have to get what you get….” “…….” Seraf quickly recovered his facial expression. However, he only recovered his facial expression. Now I could see her trying hard to hide her agitation. You must have been embarrassed to see your usual slow fluttering wings fluttering relentlessly. “Now, please wait a moment.” Seraf immediately closed his eyes. But her fingers were tapping into the air with tremendous at-bats, and her lips were chewing nonstop. Probably confirming Tanay and communicating with other angels. It’s past enough time to empty a cup of tea. In the meantime, Seraf showed numerous facial changes, and I watched it with silence. It wasn’t a common sight, so the waiting time didn’t feel boring. Then, Seraf opened his eyes. But she still looked unconvinced. “I’d like to talk to the user, Kim Soo-hyun.” “I don’t want to.” “Just a minute.” “If you’re asking me where I am right now and why I’m here, I recommend you not to. There are only two hours left before entering the rite of passage. Of course, I understand that the current situation is confusing. But… well, what else did he say?” Just following what Seraf said, she shut up at once. “As you say, we don’t have much time left to enter the rite of passage…Give me a gift, take a gift. Isn’t this reasonable behavior?” Intentionally emphasizing the word ‘reasonable’, Seraf chews on his lips. Yeah, he’ll be mad. You didn’t expect to be pushed back by humans until you came here. To be honest, I wanted to experience this situation at least once. When I first came in here, Seraf’s reaction was very cold. It feels like I’m looking at some kind of lab mouse. He didn’t even listen to me begging him to let me go, but ran from place to place and was thrown right away. I don’t know if it’s because of that memory, but this situation gave me a subtle sense of pleasure. A relaxed smile emanates from the savory mind. Seraf stared at me and flicked his finger lightly. It’s There was a sound of flesh bumping, and the flow around me slowed down a little. The body was initialized, so I couldn’t feel it in detail, but it wasn’t going anywhere for 10 years. Soon after, Seraf’s words ensued. “User Kim Soo-hyun’s argument is reasonable. Therefore, I will compensate you for the lost time. It has slowed the flow of time surrounding the summoning room. Were you satisfied?” “Yes.” I answered calmly. Seraph looked at me carefully for a moment, and quietly opened his mouth. “I also have a question about the user Kim Soo-hyun. But if you don’t like it, I won’t bother asking.” “Oh, really? I thought I’d just tell you.” He shrugged his shoulders, hoping to tease him a little more, and Seraf twinkled his eyes. “Oh, is that so? Obviously, I and all the helpers are in a mess right now. I’d like to hear the whole story if I can.” “But I don’t want to.” Only then do I realize that I played with myself, Seraf’s cheeks turn red. When I saw it, I wanted to clap and laugh out loud. She stared at me with a sulky face, and soon said, calmly organizing her expression. “There are proper restrictions on actions that go too far, but they do not harm users in the first principles of helpers. As such, please refrain from making puns with your helper in the future.” “They’re at a different level with different classes. I’ll forgive you with broad generosity.” “…I’m done checking on Tanay you mentioned. This is a kind of pledge that has ‘unrejectable’ effect, which has already been paid. In particular, the privileges granted were carefully reviewed by all and found to be the perfect user Kim Soo-hyun.”  “Well, that’s quick to understand. It’s not funny.” “Tanay means that to us. We cannot exert any influence, even if we can review it. Therefore, the perks granted to the user Kim Soo-hyun cannot be collected. You can rest assured.” “But if you start with this kind of power in your 0th year, you’ll definitely be an exception. For example, it’s out of balance..” “It doesn’t affect balance.” Seraf did not hesitate to answer. Then he continued with a slightly stern look on his face. “I read about the perks. There were definitely a lot of exceptions. But don’t be arrogant. Even if you accept all the perks, it’s not that there are no beings who have the ability to go beyond them.” But Seraph was still repeating the same thing, whether it was Seraf. Anyway, it was enough to say, “It’s not that I don’t have it.” It was very different from the evaluation that I received before. I’ve decided to take it easy. “Well, you don’t have to be distracted. Anything else deserves to be in Hallplane.” “That’s right.” The moment I said “Hall Plain,” Seraf’s eyes flashed for a moment. “It will take a lot of time to set up all the perks of Kim Soo-hyun. The current time is 1 hour, 47 minutes and 26 seconds. I think it’ll be tight to fit the rite of passage. I’m guessing you already know what’s going on inside Hallplane….” “Ok. Skip. That was what I wanted in the first place.” “It artificially slowed the flow of time, but only for the time it was rewarded. It will take some time to prepare before moving on to the next process. Please wait a moment.” While Seraf was preparing, I thought of a rite of passage. A rite of passage can simply be defined as a ‘place of testing to prove qualification as a user’. A place where people who have been kidnapped without knowing anything like me gather. There are only two conditions to pass the exam. Survive for seven days, or arrive at the Warp Gate in seven days. In other words, “survival” is a necessary condition to prove qualification. Those who succeed in surviving are called back to the Summoning Room. And they are given classes that fit their potential, and then they enter the hallplane, which is a real space. In a way, it’s a pretty unfair and creepy test. If you don’t meet the conditions of survival, you’ll be pronounced dead. “User Kim Soo-hyun. Everything is ready.” While thinking about this and that, I was able to get Seraf’s signal that he was ready. “The details of the perks are….” “I know. It’s all in my head, so I want it to start right away.” “Yes, I understand you don’t need to deliver information separately. Then, what perks would you like to be granted first?” “Well….” In turn, I thought of my first ability. 1. Grant privileges on the ability information that the user Kim Soo-hyun originally had. First, you can ‘load’ the user information you achieved in the first round. Second, randomly select four of the six basic capability information and raise the number. The degree of increase in the number is also determined at random.’ You can’t set the perks as you like. There must be a reason why Seraf ordered it. Then, the answer was to go first. This is because the beginning of all settings comes from capabilities. If the old capabilities were to be inherited, of course, it would have to be the tendency of the prosecutor, but for now, it was necessary to check the increase. I opened my mouth without any hesitation. “Road, and I’ll be given the privilege of increasing my competence.” “Yes. Recall the information entered in the name of user Kim Soo-hyun. 27%, 56%, 87% and 100%. Complete. Load completed successfully.” As soon as Seraf’s words were over, I felt my whole body rejuvenated. In addition, the slow flow around the skin becomes more obvious. Even a 23-year-old young man who just discharged from the army cannot be compared to a body that has achieved a Sword Master. Boom! As I stretched out my right arm, I heard a rough sound of breaking. I checked the user information with satisfaction. “…….” Capabilities were inherited. But everything was initialized except that. It was a waste of the leadership’s sincerity and achievement, but he nodded, thinking that he could not help it. “Confirm loading user information. Now we’re going to use the extra privilege of increasing our capabilities, right? “Yes, of course. Just in case, out of the six abilities, four will be raised randomly. Increasing capabilities and numbers are also random, but are based on the potential and degree of growth of the user. I hope you’ll keep this in mind.” “That’s how much I know.” In other words, the higher the ability, the lower the degree of increase, and the lower the ability, the higher the degree of increase. It was a law that applies equally to everyone, although there may be minor individual differences in potential. Except for the delay, elixir, and achievement rewards, there is a limit to the increase in ability by simple training. Muscular strength, stamina, mana. I prayed in my heart that these three abilities would be raised.  I think mana is the most important thing. Next is physical strength, strength, durability, and mincheop think equally. And last but not least, good luck. Of course, if only one figure is high and the other is terribly low, it could be a problem. However, the most efficient ability was horsepower, assuming that other figures supported it to some extent. “Then I’ll give it to you right now.” ‘Luck doesn’t have to go up. Please, strength, strength, mana, at least strength, mana…!’ I don’t know if my earnest heart was touched, but it seemed that the privilege was granted before I knew it. At the moment Seraf felt that he had waved his hand once, four messages popped up in the air in sight. ============================ Review of the work ============================ 1. typos and contextual corrections."
MEMORIZE,"Chapter 4 Use perks.  ========================================================================= Unknown energy is making your strength stronger. Muscle strength increases slightly.』 “An unknown energy is making your private concubine stronger. Mincheop is up slightly.』 Internal mana is exploding! It’s beyond my control! Mana is going up dramatically!』 Goddess of Fortune smiles at you! She is very interested in you! Good luck is rising dramatically!』 From the messages, it seemed that muscle strength and mincheop could not expect a significant increase. It can’t be helped. Despite his muscular strength, 96 points of agility was as high as could be counted on a hole plane. But mana and luck were not expected. Although the event was very eventful, a special message appeared. ‘It’s been a long time since I’ve felt that excitement. It’s a shame that I don’t have the strength to improvement..’ At first, I never thought that I would be granted a privilege. This was a huge deal, so I immediately updated the user information window, calming my pounding heart. 1. Name : Kim Soo-hyun (0 years) 2. Class : –  3. Country of origin: – 4. Organizations (Clan): – 5. True name and nationality: those who need to prove their qualifications, prospective users, and South Korea 6. Gender (Sex): Men (23) 7. Height · Weight: 181.5 cm · 75.5 kg 8.

A total of 104 points up.’Good. Very good. The poor numbers were eye-openingly high after the message.However, it is definitely a situation to be pleased, but the physical strength level was noticed. Compared to other abilities, there was a continuous regret in my mind.“If I’d rather have more stamina than luck….’Physical strength is important enough to be said to be a ‘column’ or ‘root’ of all other abilities. If mana is compared to the engine of a car, physical strength is a body. My physical strength now stands at 78 points, which was a very vague figure.I think I can pull out the output somehow.Whoo-hoo.’Human greed seems endless. Even though I have a much better ability than before, I am still disappointed.It wasn’t that I didn’t have any thoughts, but I decided to stop complaining. We still have a lot of privileges left. I didn’t want to kill you hanging around like this.“User Kim Soo-hyun. Would you like to move on to the next perk?”“Well, then, yeah.No, wait a minute.”I shook my head reflexively as I tried to nod casually. It’s something I can’t touch, so even if I went in right away, it wasn’t from now on. You can choose and make your own. As such, each decision should be carefully made.“Seraf, tell me the rest of your time until the rite of passage.”“One hour, 42 minutes, 23 seconds.”“Wait, wait, let me think. 30 minutes… no, not even 10 minutes.”“As the user wishes.”I immediately closed my eyes, lost in thought.I was a strong man in Hall Plain. Still, I was able to hold the zero code because I had some power. He certainly deserves to be called a strong man, but he knew himself that he could not discuss the ‘best’ or ‘best’. It was far from such a word. Significantly lower horsepower has always come back to haunt me.I’ve solved the mana problem now, but in a way, it could be just up to here. Now my body is almost out of bounds. On the surface, it’s marked as the 0 year old, but it actually loaded the 10 year old body. Although there are ways to raise their capabilities separately, such as compensation, equipment, and elixir, it was difficult to raise them to the “training” that is used in the most common way.Of course that’s not to say I’m at a disadvantage. Although it depends on individual differences, it was common to find that growth due to training stopped between 70 and 80 points on average. In that case, my current capability was at a level that would be considered super luxurious.‘But that’s a common case.’There are special cases everywhere that exceed expectations. From the start, we had to think about cases where our capability exceeded 70 points. No, from now on, we have to keep our eyes on those cases. There is no guarantee that the miracles and coincidences experienced in the first round will happen again this time. For what I wanted, I really needed enough power to achieve it.I opened my eyes. Seraf was still sitting on the altar waiting for my words. Looking at her like that, I quietly opened my mouth.“Seraf, I’ll ask you to select a class for the next privilege.”“Yes. User Kim Soo-hyun requested it. Ritual of passage, you are given priority to choose a class before entering the hallplane. We will also temporarily reveal all classified classes.”Class selection is a kind of process that can only be demonstrated by user settings. To be more specific, it was originally a process that could only be carried out in the summoning room before entering the hallplane after surviving the rite of passage. In other words, I omit the whole process and start setting up information from the beginning.I was going to choose a class related to the test again this time. As the mana increased, there was also a way to choose other classes. It wasn’t that I didn’t think about it, but I still thought that the test was the best choice. I’ve already been there once. There is a shortcut, but I didn’t feel the need to carve out a new one.A chart with information packed in the air comes to mind. Turn off the Rare chart for nothing to see. And I started looking at it slowly, leaving only the Secret chart.“List of occupations (Secret)”[War Mage][Field Maestro][Requiem Assassin][Soul Commander][Jewel Mage][Copy Archimage][Death Knight][Brilliance Priest][………….]Not this one.Not even this…Well, I’m sure the class he had….’Was there so many secret classes? I was speechless for a moment in the class that came out more than I thought. In the end, I was struggling to find it by myself, but I decided to ask Seraf for help because I thought he would eat up time.“Seraf, can’t we just make sure that the class of inspection looks separate from the secret?”“There’s nothing hard about it. Are you thinking of choosing a secret class related to the examination?”“Then what?”“I recommend it, it’s a great choice. Please wait a moment. We’ll pick them out right now.”The reason why I am strangling myself in class was because it is related to special and potential abilities and potential. The class is determined by the capability value, and the special and potential capabilities are determined by the class. This was the order I set. I had to prepare as much as I could for the two potential abilities that would be chosen at random because I was mindful of the ‘uniqueness’.“Selection is complete. I’ll upload the chart.”“Yes.”I began to scrutinize the classes Seraf filtered out again. All I wanted was a class that was easy to deal with a wizard. In the first round, the level of mana and luck was low, so I had to struggle every time I fought with the wizards. When I think about it, I still get goosebumps.I found it.And by the time the list was halfway through, I could finally find the classes I wanted.[Sword Specialist][Spell Sniper]Secret classes have their own ‘power’ for each class. Both classes appeared in the first round, and the power was ringing everywhere.The power of a sword expert has advantages in every action related to the sword, and can cut off everything that exists in the world. It was said that the power of the spell sniper was complete resistance to horsepower with a certain probability.A more detailed description of the spell sniper can resist all magic with a magical capacity of less than 75 points. And under 85 points reduces losses by 80 percent, even under 90 points by 50 percent.If he had received class privileges right away without thinking, he would have chosen a shot-in-the- This is because if one of the potential capabilities is overlapped with power, ordinary wizards can be reduced to scarecrow except for cannabis wizards who run through the limit of mana.However, after thinking about it earlier, my mind was rapidly turning to a sword expert. The power to cut off everything that exists in the world was a deadly attraction that could never be given up. I remembered a user who was an expert in swordsmanship. His dance was really great. Cut, cut, and offset numerous spells. Numerous wizards who had dealt with him were swept away like autumn leaves.Speakers are good, but swordsmanship experts are also tough.“…….”I thought about it for a while, but in the end, what I chose was a sword expert. It was an adventure in a way, but I opened my mouth in a light voice as if I were possessed.“I’ll be a sword expert.”“Sword Specialist? It’s not bad, but snipers are a pretty good jobs. Given Kim Soo-hyun’s current horsepower, there will be few wizards that can harm you.”“That’s true.”“Then why…”“On the contrary, you’re saying there is eventually one.”“…….”Seraf was still an unsavory face. At first glance, I was shaken, but I got it right and gave more strength to my voice.“I’ll give you an example, so think about it. There is a target system that guarantees success beyond a certain point, and there is a non-target system that depends on the control. The former has obvious limitations, even if it is safe to some extent. But the latter depends on my pure ability. You understand what I mean, don’t you?”“I understood.”“Then I’ll be a swordsman.”“As the user wishes.”Seraf seemed to think for a moment, and then nodded once. At the same time, I could see a message that another piece of information had been updated.Congratulations, you’ve got a Secret Class, a Sword Specialist. User information is updated.』I felt strangely relieved when I saw the message. I feel much more comfortable maybe because I passed the first crisis without any difficulty. But it’s too early to be relieved. I straightened myself up and prepared for the next perk. The next privilege was that my will could not be partially involved, so I raised tension again.‘3. Grant special abilities and perks on potential capabilities. Users will generally have one special ability slot and four potential slots, but we will open another potential slot for Kim Soo-hyun. It also opens up both special and potential capabilities, including hidden capabilities, and allows you to choose what you want.And the other way, you can open up a slot called ‘unique ability’. A unique ability is a capability that is above a special ability. If you give up your own ability, you can choose all five special abilities as your own (at this point, open slots automatically include in your potential).)’Slowly reflect on the information entered in your head.Special and potential capabilities are characterized by flowering one by one depending on one’s tendency. In other words, it was a huge benefit to set and start the competence from the beginning. That’s how much it means to start at a different starting line from other users. However, it was necessary to be as careful as that in choosing.Again, special, potential is the most important part that affects the character’s efficiency. Users become stronger if they get properties that match their classes. But what if it’s the other way around? This means that the efficiency of this class will not be able to be achieved. That’s why if you want to be strong, you have to harmonize your abilities, classes, and abilities.“Seraf, the next privilege is empowerment.”“Yes, then I’ll ask. Please let us know if the unique ability slot is enabled or not. The difference is….”“I know. I’ll choose my own abilities.”“Okay, I’ll consume one potential slot. Two of the four remaining slots will also be selected at random.”There is a belief. Similar rules apply to ability opening, just as the degree of growth of users in increasing capabilities has been considered. In short, I meant that there is a good chance of being affected by my body that achieved the Sword Master. If I’m sure, it’s highly likely that two of the abilities I had in the first round will be selected.While bouncing the abacus inside, Seraf signaled if he was ready.“We’ve brought up a list of unique abilities, special abilities, and potential capabilities. Do you want to choose first or open two slots of potential?”It wasn’t without a grain of anxiety. But it’s better to be beaten first. I decided to spin two potentials first.“I’ll open up two slots first.”============================ Review of the work ============================1.

On the surface, it’s marked as the 0 year old, but it actually loaded the 10 year old body. Although there are ways to raise their capabilities separately, such as compensation, equipment, and elixir, it was difficult to raise them to the “training” that is used in the most common way. Of course that’s not to say I’m at a disadvantage. Although it depends on individual differences, it was common to find that growth due to training stopped between 70 and 80 points on average. In that case, my current capability was at a level that would be considered super luxurious. ‘But that’s a common case.’ There are special cases everywhere that exceed expectations. From the start, we had to think about cases where our capability exceeded 70 points. No, from now on, we have to keep our eyes on those cases. There is no guarantee that the miracles and coincidences experienced in the first round will happen again this time. For what I wanted, I really needed enough power to achieve it. I opened my eyes. Seraf was still sitting on the altar waiting for my words. Looking at her like that, I quietly opened my mouth. “Seraf, I’ll ask you to select a class for the next privilege.”  “Yes. User Kim Soo-hyun requested it. Ritual of passage, you are given priority to choose a class before entering the hallplane. We will also temporarily reveal all classified classes.” Class selection is a kind of process that can only be demonstrated by user settings. To be more specific, it was originally a process that could only be carried out in the summoning room before entering the hallplane after surviving the rite of passage. In other words, I omit the whole process and start setting up information from the beginning. I was going to choose a class related to the test again this time. As the mana increased, there was also a way to choose other classes. It wasn’t that I didn’t think about it, but I still thought that the test was the best choice. I’ve already been there once. There is a shortcut, but I didn’t feel the need to carve out a new one. A chart with information packed in the air comes to mind. Turn off the Rare chart for nothing to see. And I started looking at it slowly, leaving only the Secret chart. “List of occupations (Secret)” Not this one.Not even this…Well, I’m sure the class he had….’ Was there so many secret classes? I was speechless for a moment in the class that came out more than I thought. In the end, I was struggling to find it by myself, but I decided to ask Seraf for help because I thought he would eat up time. “Seraf, can’t we just make sure that the class of inspection looks separate from the secret?” “There’s nothing hard about it. Are you thinking of choosing a secret class related to the examination?” “Then what?” “I recommend it, it’s a great choice. Please wait a moment. We’ll pick them out right now.” The reason why I am strangling myself in class was because it is related to special and potential abilities and potential. The class is determined by the capability value, and the special and potential capabilities are determined by the class. This was the order I set. I had to prepare as much as I could for the two potential abilities that would be chosen at random because I was mindful of the ‘uniqueness’. “Selection is complete. I’ll upload the chart.” “Yes.” I began to scrutinize the classes Seraf filtered out again. All I wanted was a class that was easy to deal with a wizard. In the first round, the level of mana and luck was low, so I had to struggle every time I fought with the wizards. When I think about it, I still get goosebumps. I found it. And by the time the list was halfway through, I could finally find the classes I wanted. Secret classes have their own ‘power’ for each class. Both classes appeared in the first round, and the power was ringing everywhere. The power of a sword expert has advantages in every action related to the sword, and can cut off everything that exists in the world. It was said that the power of the spell sniper was complete resistance to horsepower with a certain probability. A more detailed description of the spell sniper can resist all magic with a magical capacity of less than 75 points. And under 85 points reduces losses by 80 percent, even under 90 points by 50 percent. If he had received class privileges right away without thinking, he would have chosen a shot-in-the- This is because if one of the potential capabilities is overlapped with power, ordinary wizards can be reduced to scarecrow except for cannabis wizards who run through the limit of mana. However, after thinking about it earlier, my mind was rapidly turning to a sword expert. The power to cut off everything that exists in the world was a deadly attraction that could never be given up. I remembered a user who was an expert in swordsmanship. His dance was really great. Cut, cut, and offset numerous spells. Numerous wizards who had dealt with him were swept away like autumn leaves. Speakers are good, but swordsmanship experts are also tough. “…….” I thought about it for a while, but in the end, what I chose was a sword expert. It was an adventure in a way, but I opened my mouth in a light voice as if I were possessed. “I’ll be a sword expert.” “Sword Specialist? It’s not bad, but snipers are a pretty good jobs. Given Kim Soo-hyun’s current horsepower, there will be few wizards that can harm you.” “That’s true.” “Then why…” “On the contrary, you’re saying there is eventually one.” “…….” Seraf was still an unsavory face. At first glance, I was shaken, but I got it right and gave more strength to my voice. “I’ll give you an example, so think about it. There is a target system that guarantees success beyond a certain point, and there is a non-target system that depends on the control. The former has obvious limitations, even if it is safe to some extent. But the latter depends on my pure ability. You understand what I mean, don’t you?” “I understood.” “Then I’ll be a swordsman.” “As the user wishes.” Seraf seemed to think for a moment, and then nodded once. At the same time, I could see a message that another piece of information had been updated. Congratulations, you’ve got a Secret Class, a Sword Specialist. User information is updated.』  I felt strangely relieved when I saw the message. I feel much more comfortable maybe because I passed the first crisis without any difficulty. But it’s too early to be relieved. I straightened myself up and prepared for the next perk. The next privilege was that my will could not be partially involved, so I raised tension again. ‘3. Grant special abilities and perks on potential capabilities. Users will generally have one special ability slot and four potential slots, but we will open another potential slot for Kim Soo-hyun. It also opens up both special and potential capabilities, including hidden capabilities, and allows you to choose what you want. And the other way, you can open up a slot called ‘unique ability’. A unique ability is a capability that is above a special ability. If you give up your own ability, you can choose all five special abilities as your own (at this point, open slots automatically include in your potential).)’ Slowly reflect on the information entered in your head. Special and potential capabilities are characterized by flowering one by one depending on one’s tendency. In other words, it was a huge benefit to set and start the competence from the beginning. That’s how much it means to start at a different starting line from other users. However, it was necessary to be as careful as that in choosing. Again, special, potential is the most important part that affects the character’s efficiency. Users become stronger if they get properties that match their classes. But what if it’s the other way around? This means that the efficiency of this class will not be able to be achieved. That’s why if you want to be strong, you have to harmonize your abilities, classes, and abilities. “Seraf, the next privilege is empowerment.” “Yes, then I’ll ask. Please let us know if the unique ability slot is enabled or not. The difference is….” “I know. I’ll choose my own abilities.” “Okay, I’ll consume one potential slot. Two of the four remaining slots will also be selected at random.” There is a belief. Similar rules apply to ability opening, just as the degree of growth of users in increasing capabilities has been considered. In short, I meant that there is a good chance of being affected by my body that achieved the Sword Master. If I’m sure, it’s highly likely that two of the abilities I had in the first round will be selected. While bouncing the abacus inside, Seraf signaled if he was ready. “We’ve brought up a list of unique abilities, special abilities, and potential capabilities. Do you want to choose first or open two slots of potential?” It wasn’t without a grain of anxiety. But it’s better to be beaten first. I decided to spin two potentials first. “I’ll open up two slots first.” ============================ Review of the work ============================ 1. Delete the contents of Hallplane and Kim Soo-hyun. 2. Modification of special ability flowering contents. 3. Typing and contextual correction."
MEMORIZE,"Chapter 5 Use perks.  ========================================================================= Hallplane is a world where power, to be exact, “user information,” is the top priority. The world of putting together all the information one has, including annual leave, propensity, ability, and ability, and making value judgments with it. Maybe that’s why you’re being so sensitive. Certainly, I didn’t expect to be granted perks, and it was impossible to make a perfect setup in a short time. But I have 10 years of experience. I wanted to live. If I wanted to live, I had to have power. The desire for survival soon led to the desire for power. What kind of skills should I improve and how to be strong. I agonized and researched countless times. It was not just a slap-match that reached Master’s reach with a magical capacity of 48 points. I didn’t know it would be used like this, but the privileges granted were perfect for utilizing the knowledge that had been studied. The randomly selected potentials didn’t go against my expectations. Fortunately, I was relieved to read the names of the abilities that entered the two empty slots. What was left were one slot of unique ability, one slot of special ability, and two slots of potential ability. And it was not until I finished choosing the unique, special, and potential capabilities that I agonized over and over again that I could breathe a sigh of relief. “Phew. I’m done picking.” “…….” At that time, a subtle look was felt. There are only two in the summoning room anyway. I could tell who was looking at me right now without having to look.  The last farewell to Seraf was affectionate. However, ten years of enmity has not been completely resolved. Moreover, now that I know some internal circumstances, it was a long way from seeing the angel in front of me. I didn’t look at Seraf on purpose. I looked away for a while, but there was a limit. I finally decided to open my mouth because I couldn’t overcome Seraf’s uncomfortable gaze. “What are you looking at?” I asked in a voice full of bulges on purpose, but my eyes became more subtle. Seraf exchanged eyes with me for a moment and said in a slightly recalled voice. “User Kim Soo-hyun’s ability. And the unique, special, potential capabilities chosen from the perks. We have combined the settings divided into these two areas and the settings of the swordsmanship expert. Then I was able to make one inference. “Whom will you do you?” “It’s up to the helper.” I had to feel a little absurd when I saw Seraph responding right away. Did the angel just make a joke? Or are you serious? Maybe it’s half and half, but I ended up nodding my head. “Yeah, whatever it takes.” “I felt that there was a lot of research on competence. It feels like a user who has experienced a space called Hallplane for a long time.” “Ha ha. That’s ridiculous.” I felt a sharp prick in my stomach for a moment. But when asked back calmly, Seraf shook his head slowly from side to side. “Nothing.” “I admit I’m a bit of an odd personality. “I’m not talking about behavior. The efficiency obtained by using the perks of the user Kim Soo-hyun far exceeded the angels’ expectations. Without first-hand experience with hallplanes, that choice never comes.” “Wait a minute here. You can’t stay put.” “No, I repeat, you don’t have to worry about perks. Angels are different from humans. I don’t say it in one bite. Well, anyway. I think I know roughly what the user Kim Soo-hyun is aiming for. That’s all.” Seraf’s voice was filled with feelings of genuine admiration. But what she said was significant. I couldn’t be more proud of my heart, which had been stinging since earlier. To be honest, even if I did research, what I’m aiming for now was based on the class of one of the best-known users in the past. Famous is also famous, but I remember it in more detail because it has the same name as me. Sword expert Jin Soo-hyun. The secret class was so powerful that it was called a nightmare by wizards that it showed off its power in the Great Wizard War. Jin Soo-hyun was a user who entered Hallplane later than me. The difference would be about a year’s But he shortened a year by the word effort. And it quickly overtook me with the word talent. Considering my own efforts, the feeling of loss I felt at the time still made my heart ache. Anyway, if we get back to the point, it’s almost impossible to implement Jin Soo-hyun’s information right now. First of all, he wasn’t very close to me, and he wasn’t a crazy user to tell others his information. Even if the basic essentials are inherited as they are, in the overall context, they only account for 20 percent. The remaining 80% should be bone-building and flesh-building by mixing their own interpretations. As I said earlier, I was going to believe in my ten years of experience and experience. “Anyway, stop looking at me like that.” Seraf quietly shut his mouth when he openly expressed his discomfort. I’ll take the sword expert.’ It’s not that I don’t feel sorry, so I prayed for Jin Soo-hyun for a while. Don’t worry too much because you’ll be successful even if you choose another class that’s not an expert. After such a non-prayer prayer, I turned to the next privilege. Fourth privilege. ‘4. Only once, you can undergo a physical modification procedure.’ There is nothing special about a modification procedure. Of course, there have been cases where you have seen a part of your body replaced by a machine or deliberately summoning the existence of this space. However, that was only the case if the limbs were completely lost due to unavoidable circumstances. As long as I had a healthy, healthy body, I didn’t want to give up a part of my body. Even if you don’t have to, you can be as strong as you want.  What I had in mind was a tattoo procedure. This process was an integral part of the plan’s completion. Without one tattoo procedure, the success rate of the plan is as dangerous as less than 30%. What I asked for on my fifth perk was as powerful and dangerous. He spent a lot of time during his third privilege, so he decided to ask for tattooing immediately. “Well, let’s see. I’d rather get a simple tattoo or treatment than a grand renovation.” “It’s possible. I’ll show you the tattoo list chart. Please wait a moment.” “Oh, it’s okay. I know your name. I’d like a tattoo of an ancient lady’s imprint.” “Where would you like your tattoo engraved?” I raised my right hand with a nonchalant face. And the moment Seraf’s gaze followed my right hand, his fingers pointed at my left chest. “Heart.” “The heart…?” “Why?” “…….” Seraf’s face was still. He didn’t say anything. But it was clear in the present that I would be calculating at a speed that I wouldn’t dare to imagine. I felt sorry for trying to figure out my intentions, but of course I didn’t intend to let you know yet. Most common tattoos are carved over the skin. However, it is not desirable to treat the heart through the imprint of magic using ancient magic. The organization responsible for the center of mana used by users is the heart and circuitry. Engraving tattoos on the heart that could directly or indirectly affect horsepower reactions posed a risk of what problems might explode. However, the tattoo of an ancient lady is different. Perhaps I’d have to argue with Seraf for a while if I’d said a general tattoo. This is because there were many problems with general tattoos, such as procedures involving horsepower amplification or quantity. However, the imprint of the ancient lady differs from the common tattoos. There are two functions in total. First, it stabilizes itself when mana explodes. Second, it helps to lead the flow of mana efficiently. Seraf must be very concerned right now, as she is an ancient lady imprint with such net function. Staring at her lips, feeling a little nervous. This procedure was the only key to my successful plan, which is highly likely to fail. Soon after, Seraf’s fine lips slowly opened. “Yes.” Bingo “I accept the request of the user Kim Soo-hyun. It will take exactly 5 minutes and 7 seconds. Then I’ll do the procedure right away.” “Okay.” At that moment, ancient characters spewing bright blue light were created into the air in front of their eyes, and soon began to circle around the body as if drawing an oval shape. At the same time, I could hear the solemn voices of the ladies as a son-in-law. Five minutes later, the ancient texts slowly circled around the heart one by one. Even if it’s a heart, it doesn’t really hurt. On the contrary, every time a text message came in, I felt a little energized. It was not long before the last text in the last line came in and the procedure could be concluded. I couldn’t feel what had changed right away. But you’ll find out soon enough if you use mana. I immediately started checking the mana. Oh, my God. At first, I thought it would be a little difficult to operate due to the explosive amount of horsepower, but I don’t feel pressured at all. Mana forces flowing smoothly along the circuit. The procedure was successful. I felt pleased with the unexpected satisfactory performance. “That’s good, Seraph? Tell me the time you have left.” “It’s 48 minutes and 39 seconds before we reach the rite of passage.” 48 minutes and 39 seconds. I slightly smacked my lips. Judging from the lack of words, Seraf seemed to think he had enough time. But I think it’s tight. The remaining fifth privilege was a gambling adventure. As life cannot be guaranteed, there is a great danger. But considering the need, a process that can never be avoided. With a wobbly mind, he recalled a fifth privilege. ‘5. User Kim Soo-hyun can select one equipment he wants, and there is no restriction on the type. However, you cannot select EX grade equipment.’ In a way, the option was a fairly wide privilege. Sword, armor, elixir, accessories, etc. However, if you choose such common things, you will lose the meaning of getting tattooed by an ancient lady. That’s how much the fifth privilege was necessary for me. “Farm of fire, that would be better. I’ll do that for the fifth perk.” “I approve the request of Kim Soo-hyun’s request…?” The ending went up strangely. Seraf changed the ending to a questionable shape and frowned slightly. Did he get caught?’ It is highly likely that you have noticed my intentions. Still, the request for approval was made normally, and Seraf’s right hand had a small red bead.  “…….” “…….” They don’t say anything to each other. But you can tell by Seraf’s eyes. She has no intention of handing me a bead. As expected, Seraf seemed to be right, but he gave a stern look and fired a reprimanded look. I also took her gaze head-on, stiffening my face. “User Kim Soo-hyun.” “Tanay.” “Of course it is. But this is a different matter. No matter how Tanay is, I can advise you if you can harm your users.” “Intervention under the guise of advice. Don’t talk nonsense. Give it to me. I need the composure of fire. Do you think I’m crazy about the other good procedures and I’ve had a strict ancient ladyless procedure?” This is why I hate Seraf. There were many cases where they fought for something they would give anyway, and ended the work in a state of their feelings were hurt. When I remembered that time, habitually harsh words rose to the tip of my throat. But her eyes, which looked at me fondly before breaking up, suddenly brushed my head. I listened with my mouth shut reflexively. It was worth listening to at least once. “I pay tribute to your creativity. It’s amazing that humans came up with this idea. But that’s all.” “…….” “User Kim Soo-hyun. I wonder how much you know about the composition of fire.” “…that you can burn everything?” “Similar. Another name for the fire’s flower is the ever-burning chlorine. The most destructive fire known to the world is the cowardice of hell. But this pure collection of fire, the flowering, has a dangerous power comparable to his equivalent. This is literally a fire for destruction.” “I know. I know everything, so I’m asking for it.” “Durable 92. Mana 90. Estimated success probability 21%. If you include the imprint of an ancient lady, 42% chance of success, in other words, 58% chance of failure, more than half.” Seraf was desperately trying to persuade me. However hard I tried, the perks were eventually rated Tanay. As she said, I may give advice, but I can’t stop my decision. So, I stretched out my right hand and proudly demanded compassion. “We can succeed.” I said it, but it was very comfortable. Maybe Seraf’s outfit is upside down by now? I’ve told you so much that it doesn’t even work. She was now pleading almost to the point of clinging. “It’s a problem to succeed, not to mention failure. If you fail, you lose everything and become a scoundrel. If you succeed, there will be unexpected disadvantages.” “I think I read that all equipment is paid except EX grade. Was Hwajeong rated EX? “Originally, the fire was rated EX. It’s an equipment that exists on the hallplane but cannot appear. But it’s a long way from getting it, and it’s down to grade S through balancing work, but the risk is gone….” There will definitely be no end to this. Feeling very tired, she raised her hand and stopped talking. I’d like to listen to it until the end, but I’m running out of time. Or, it occurred to me that Seraf could drag time to the rite of passage. “I don’t want to blush anymore.” “It’s hard with over 90 endurance and horsepower, but I’m only 78 strength is 78. I understand your confidence, but I want you to see the reality.” Of course I know what Seraf is worried about. Her anxiety was warm enough for any ordinary person to move a little bit at the earnest persuasion. But I just can’t. I would rather yield if I gave up something else. This was a long and hard one. If you give up the peace as it is…. “It’s not easy to recover. If we drag on more time, we’ll be half-dead and we’ll be in the process of passing.” “User Kim Soo-hyun.” “I won’t tell you any more. I’ll make sure you’re ready for it.” At the end of the day, I was cold-blooded. I don’t know if he’s reading a serious atmosphere or can’t resist Tanay anymore, but Seraf slowly wiggled his fingers. Her face was still full of complaints, but soon she showed her compassion toward me. However, it was not given beautifully. “Even if you succeed, there will be a day when you will regret it.” “Okay….” Dudungsil. The harmony of fire. Pure collection of fire. Chloride burning forever. The preparation process is not necessary. It’s been a long time since I made up my mind, and I don’t have much time left to calculate the aftermath. Hwajeong drew a thin scarlet trajectory and came straight into my mouth. Gulp. Finally, I got the passion. It was only then that the wreath came into my arms. Controlling the surge of relief and joy, I quickly looked inside. It’s a crumpled.  As I gulped down my throat, I felt a round bead going over my esophagus. From now on, it was the beginning of a real crisis. ============================ Review of the work ============================ 1.
